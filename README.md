This software aim at simulating single electron in a solar cell absorber with a specific electric field. It uses a SCAPS-1D EB file as input to get the base electric field, to which can be added effective electric fields to represent specific band engineering. These features can be:
- band grading (default at the moment)
- quantum dots (to be added)
- more to come
